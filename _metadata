  "description" : "Huge credit to @BBFZ0R on Steam for making the Colony Deed Wiring Mod. The wiring feature is so useful and I just can't live without it! \n\nThis mod is in BETA. It should be very stable. I am leaving it in beta until I've added all of the new tenants in that I want to and create proper presentation and documention for the mod and the new tenants. When I reach 1.0 I will upload it to the Chucklefish forums as well.\n\n[h1]Themed Deeds Compatability Patch[/h1]\nA patch to add compatability is now available. [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=756738410]Addon Link[/url]\n\n[h1]Introduction[/h1]\nColony Tweaks is a mod that changes the colonist rent system and adds new tenants. This mod patches all tenants to use a new rent pool that contains only money. The Colony Deed script has been changed to assign a \"level\" of the pool based on the total amount of furniture tags inside a home. This means that the more furniture there is in a home the higher the rent will be. Planetary diffiiculty is no longer accounted for and rent is only scaled based on the contents of homes. Be aware that merchants that spawn with weapons in their inventories will still respect the difficulty of the planet they're on.\n\n[h1]Information[/h1]\nRent is no longer explicitly tier based. Rent starts at ~25 pixels and scales upward based on factors such as the quantity and quality of placed furniture, tracked tenant happiness factors, and planet threat level. Most decent housing will be worth a fair amount of pixels. Sometimes it can be a little iffy due to wild variations in tagging on furniture objects.\n\nI implemened the wiring feature from the Colony Deed Wiring mod. If I don't implement it directly into my scripts it's basically a fool's errand to make the two mods compatible since that mod also has to change the deed scripts. \n\nSeveral new tenants have been added corresponding to the biomes in the game that have available costumes and furniture. I've also dramatically overhauled the inventory of colony merchants. All of the game's blocks and throwable weapons are now patched with a price value so that they are buyable and sellable. Special merchants now sell various furniture and costume items from their biomes. Some of them also sell blocks and liquids.  \n\nThe \"Wealthy Merchant\" is especailly useful because he will sell things like Executive, Wave, Opulent, Serene, Doom, and Geometric furnitures, and certain rare items like normally unobtainable paintings. These items are marked up at an extreme price to better represent their rarity and give you something to spend those pixels on.\n\n\n[h1]New NPC List[/h1]\n[b]List may be temporary if I can come up with a better way to present this[/b]\n\nT4 Dungeon Guard (Add t4 durasteel furniture to dungeon furniture house, ex. floranhuntinggrounds or aviantomb)\nT5 Guards (12x of one type: Opulent, Doom, Serene, Geometric, Executive, Wave)\nT6 Guards (30x of one type: Opulent, Doom, Serene, Geometric, Executive, Wave)\n\nAll merchants require commerce tags!\n\nSlime Merchant.

(combat + storage) (Sells randomly generated common, uncommon, and rare weapons)\n\nExpect future changes to various tenant inventories, including adding or removing items, and changing their stock rarities.\n\n[h1]Planned Features[/h1]\nIn the future I want to add basic villager tenants with unique personalities for all of the biomes. I also need to write custom lines for the vast majority of my new NPCs. \nI need to add a merchant that sells miscellaneous throwing items to replace the ones that you previously got from rent. I also need to add in a merchant that sells a lot of the costumes that you'd normally have a chance to get from rent drops. This is a lot of tedious pick and choose copy/paste work that I haven't gotten around to yet. \n\n[h1]Known Issues:[/h1]\nIf you collect rent from a house that doesn't have all of the world chunks it occupies loaded completely it won't properly account for all of the house contents. I probably won't even try to fix this because of the potential negative reprecussions of attempting to force additional world chunks to be loaded. The solution is just to make sure larger buildings are fully loaded on the screen before you collect rent from them.\n\nIf you try to use Themed Deeds with this mod it won't crash but the rent the tenants spawn will be broken and based on planet level. This will result in absurdly high unintentional rent values. Will work base mod around to fix this issue. Please use the addon mod I am providing to allow full Themed Deeds functionality.\n\n[h1]Disclaimers: [/h1]\nThis is a BETA release of this mod. \n\nThis mod MUST be installed on the SERVER SIDE in order for it to work. It adds new tenants and changes object scripts. \n\nUninstalling this mod probably won't actually ♥♥♥♥ anything up beyond forcing all of the new tenants you spawned to crash and their colony deeds to fail and need replacing. If you have to uninstall it just remove all your deeds. \n\nThere is a chance that when you first install this it could duplicate all of your tenants. This happens when one of the lua scripts crashes. I will never knowingly release a version that would cause such a crash.\n\nI've overwritten the default scripts for the colony deed. This isn't compatible with the Colony Deed Wiring mod because both mods change the script. This mod forces tenants to use a completely new rent pool, so mods that change the vanilla rent pools won't cause any problems, but also won't have any affects. ",
