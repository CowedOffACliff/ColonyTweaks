# ColonyTweaks
Colony Tweaks mod for Starbound as developed by CowedOffACliff (Aka, Mostly Alone, Lord Baconator)

Colony Tweaks is a mod that overwrites the default Colony Deed Lua scripts to provide new functionality to the Colony Deed.

The primary feature of the mod is a modified tenant rent system that is pixel based and varies per tenant based on a variety of factors.

Currently the rent system includes factors such as:
  Number of object tags in the home.
  Number of objects in the home.
  How close the Colony Deed is to other Colony Deeds. (very minor)
  A rent over time benefit. Every time you collect rent a tiny bonus modifier is applied, up to 10 stacks.
  Tenant reputation level:
    Tenant reputation scales up and down between -100 and 100 and applies a dramatic percentage modifier.
    Reputation goes up when good things happen to the NPC like socialization, quest completion, and being saved from monsters.
    Reputation goes down when the NPC is damaged, dies, has negative status effects applied, or is stolen from.
